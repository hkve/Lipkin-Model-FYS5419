  abstract = {In order to test the validity of various techniques and formalisms developed for treating many-particle systems, a model is constructed which is simple enough to be solved exactly in some cases, but yet is non-trivial. The construction of such models is based on the observation that bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators can be considered as generators of Lie groups. Thus the problem of finding eigenvalues can be greatly simplified by the additional integrals of the motion which are present if the Hamiltonian is constructed so as to commute with invariants of the group. In the present case, the model consists of N fermions distributed in two N-fold degenerate levels and interacting via a monopole-monopole force. It is shown that the model Hamiltonian is easily expressed in terms of quasi-spin operators and exact eigenvalues are obtained. In addition, eigenvalues are calculated with ordinary perturbation theory using values for the number of particles and interaction strength which are appropriate to the more realistic problems of finite nuclei. In subsequent papers we consider the results obtained by various other approximation methods for comparison with the exact results presented here.},

  abstract = {We simulate the excited states of the Lipkin model using the recently proposed quantum equation of motion (qEOM) method. The qEOM generalizes the EOM on classical computers and gives access to collective excitations based on quasiboson operators Ë†Oâ€ n(Î±) of increasing configuration complexity Î±. We show, in particular, that the accuracy strongly depends on the fermion to qubit encoding. Standard encoding leads to large errors, but the use of symmetries and the Gray code reduces the quantum resources and improves significantly the results on current noisy quantum devices. With this encoding scheme, we use IBM quantum machines to compute the energy spectrum for a system of N=2, 3, and 4 particles, and compare the accuracy against the exact solution. We found that the results of the approach with Î±=2, an analog of the second random phase approximation (SRPA), are, in principle, more accurate than with Î±=1, which corresponds to the random phase approximation (RPA), but the SRPA is more amenable to noise for large coupling strengths. Thus, the proposed scheme shows potential for achieving higher spectroscopic accuracy by implementations with higher configuration complexity, if a proper error mitigation method is applied.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a collection of theoretical works aiming at adjusting quantum algorithms to the hardware of quantum computers. The overarching topic of these efforts is to enable digital quantum simulation, the process of approximating the ground state of an arbitrary physical system with elementary operations of a quantum computer. For fermionic systems, a class including molecules and materials, the impact of quantum computing would be undoubtedly high, and algorithms exist for their simulation. However, there is a certain gap between the requirements of those algorithms and what actual quantum devices can provide: it seems that our expectations of a fully-fledged quantum computer still exceed our capabilities to build it. To make quantum simulation feasible, we seek to adapt quantum algorithms to three different types of device limitations within this thesis.},
